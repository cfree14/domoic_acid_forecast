Data Notes

Note: my program only entered crab data into our database for a limited time as technically it’s not within my program’s scope and handled by the CDPH Food and Drug Branch. (I don’t think FDB had good long-term recordkeeping prior to like 2016)

 

Note: the “# of individuals” field is the number of individuals pooled together for the sample. It’s a relatively new field and was back filled for some samples based on the note field. It mostly applies to the razor clams.

The mussel and oyster samples are pools of >10 individuals as per the sample protocol and this is not recorded in the table.

 

Domoic acid data

-“ASP ug/g” = amnesic shellfish poisoning micrograms per gram = domoic acid parts per million (ppm).

-The “Mod” data field before the biotoxin value field is a modifier field that should be added in front of the biotoxin value (IE. <2.5 ppm domoic acid).

-Mussel and oyster samples are homogenates of at least 12 or more individuals. Other species of shellfish may not contain this minimum number.  

-Sample station coordinates are approximate. These have not been QCd or ground-truthed and may be incorrect. 

- Only a portion of the commercial growing areas are tested for domoic acid routinely. For other areas it is usually event driven based on presence of Pseudo-nitzschia.

-The shellfish growing area samples are generally collected weekly. There may be some breaks in data due to an area being temporarily closed for a variety of reasons.

-The non-commercial sample sites are not sampled on a routine basis. Volunteer sampling is sporadic, based on the schedules of volunteers and plankton events. This data is not good for time series analysis. 

-Duplicate samples: In some rare instances, a sample was tested twice. There may be some instances of duplicate data in the database. We tried to remove these duplicates, but some may remain.

-Sentinel mussels are mussels that have been placed in bags at a specific location (usually on a pier or buoy) for the purpose of collecting samples.

-Tested via HPLC. Method from: J.S. Dhoot, A.R. Del Rosario, B.R. Appel and B.R. Tamplin, “ An Improved HPLC Procedure for Domoic Acid Analysis in Seafood,” Intern. J. Environ. Anal. Chem., Vol.53, pp.261-268 (1993)

Razor clams

- Samples between approximately 2016-2021 should be for individual clams unless noted, but this is not guaranteed. Samples prior to 2016 may be individuals (more likely the dates with multiple samples from the same location) or pooled samples.  

- Razor clams are a recreational fishery in California, this data does not represent a commercial fishery.
